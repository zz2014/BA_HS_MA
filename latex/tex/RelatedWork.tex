Extensive research has been done in the field of comparative studies of programming language. There have been lots of studies evaluating and analyzing Web server performance. Lei, Ma and Tan has studied and compared the performance of Node.js, Python-Web and PHP using benchmark tests and scenario tests\citep{node-related}. The result shows that Node.js is an idea fit for I/O intensive websites. A comparison betwwen Java and PHP is conducted by Neves, Paiva and Duraes in terms of performance and security\citep{java-related}. It is concluded that Java is more scalable and secure than PHP. \\
Although the comparison between Java and Node.js are quite rare among published paper and technological reports, a quite thorough comparison for almost all the web technologies are done by the TechEmpower \cite{Benchmark}. The tests are conducted in physical and cloud environment. From the results, one can see Java exceeds the Node.js in almost all aspects of performance. \\
In comparison with all the work mentioned above, this thesis has regulated the tests in a PaaS cloud offering. In addition to the performance of single application, the scalability is also identified. The focus of thesis is set on single transaction which is a main SAP business scenario.
