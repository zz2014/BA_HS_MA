\chapter{Conclusion}
The aim of the thesis is to compare the performance Java and Node.js with a focus of SAP use case. The example applications are minimized in its complexity of implementation and functionality. The consumption of resources are also kept in a low level. Still, both technologies have reached 20\% of average requests handling of Google\citep{Google}. This is a quite good and firm performance. For SAP business scenario, the CPU usage is would rarely be pushed to 100\% before a limitation in database or router surfaces first. Of course, the application should be properly optimized first and minimal with regard to CPU.
