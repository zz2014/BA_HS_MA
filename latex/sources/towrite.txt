- push java application to CF - working with assembly plugin 
- java 
   - warm-up2, 
- elevate java efficiency:
   - pooling: DBPC,HIRAKI 
- use concurrency library for saving response time

- what have been tried to elevate node efficiency:
   - pg library: pg-node, pg-pool, pg-promise,sequelizer, generic pool
   - consulting the internet benchmark testing sequelizer
   - use hana db

- write more about finding limitation in HAProxy:
   - scale the application, to see the requests can also scale
   - two identical applications are pushed with different DB service but the same route
   - pushed an application with no connection or usage of DB
   - create load generator in Java with multithreading

- discussion about whether 3 node = 1 java:
   - cost of memory and cpu 
   - therefore fair test strategy: comparing with existing benchmarks

- write in technological background, not using excel directly

- Future work: 
  - video of the guy 
  - test with framework

- log from Kibana: only time range, not exact
